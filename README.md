# Incorrect Conditional Rendering in useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook where conditional rendering logic within the effect is not correctly handling all possible states. This can lead to unexpected behavior and missed updates.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` function uses the `useEffect` hook to log a message when the `count` state variable is greater than 0. However, this only covers one state and misses other states that are not greater than 0. This can lead to missed updates in other states or cause the application to misbehave. The solution introduces a proper conditional rendering logic to resolve this issue.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates a more robust approach to conditional rendering in the `useEffect` hook by handling all possible states of the `count` variable. This ensures that the application behaves as expected regardless of the value of `count`.  A better approach might also involve using the effect's return value to cleanup actions.
